## Design

### Dodging/Blocking

If stamina allows, a player will dodge/block an attack automatically, but will still suffer the knockback of the attack.

### Life/Death

A fighter can act as long as HP and SP are above 0. 0HP is considered dead.

### Waiting

Waiting costs only 1 stamina, making it more likely to be the next one to move, but waiting twice in a row gives a stamina penality.
